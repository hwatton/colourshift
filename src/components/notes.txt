components:

make more with functions, not classes.
make a levels object that's exported into game.
each object is a level, which can have it's own file elsewhere.

navbar: basic with title and menu, which should have three li items .
    > about, accessibility apology.

    >don;t use bootstrap. can of worms. do it plain, witha flex.

footer. include copyright and date it.


gamebox/holds all games and current state for game play.
> gamespace   > grid    >selection handles
                        >game area
              > non grid entry level game space

> tile holder /tools    > row tiles
                        > col tiles
                        > single components (entry level)



composition of omponents:

gamebox : state, functions to update state. class based, probably large.

grid : class based maybe, might help with d3 interaction( componentDid update etc)
      > d3 based function separate exported module?
      > keep class clean and pass the leg work to this module?

non grid > class based, but only to use lifecycle. good use case for a hook if I can wokr it out!
    > write as class and make function in an update once I understand this better



functionality. make browser "back" render home page when inside game play.
